THE SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFE
By Shaun Cronick

It's the simple things in life,
That make the world go round.
Like remembering a lost thought,
For a story that will astound.

The falling of an autumn leaf,
That spirals slowly down.
Your first taste of ice-cream,
The one called chocolate brown.

The bright colours of a rainbow,
That arc across the land.
Finally completing a majestic castle,
On sunny seaside sand.

The viewing of a raindrop as it,
Rapidly runs down a window pane.
Quickly chansed by many others,
On and on and forever again.

Feeling so overjoyed for finding,
A lucky four-leaf clover.
And so entranced at saucepan milk,
Rise up and then spill over.

For to view life's simple things,
There lies a simple choice.
We can simply choose to ignore them,
Or enjoy and give them voice.

A stroll beneath the moonlit night,
With shadows soft and long.
Whispers of a distant breeze,
Singing nature's lullaby song.

The warmth of a comforting hug,
In times of joy or strife.
The dance of fireflies at dusk,
Painting magic in their light.

A moment shared with a friend,
In laughter or in tears.
Finding solace in a starry sky,
Dispelling all our fears.

Life's tapestry woven with threads,
Of moments pure and sweet.
A symphony of simple things,
In every heartbeat's beat.
